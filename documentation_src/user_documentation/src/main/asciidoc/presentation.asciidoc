== Presentation

K3 is an action language build  on top of the Xtend programming language in order to use it for **executable metamodeling**.


Its key feature allows
to "re-open" classes of an Ecore metamodel and to weave new features or 
operations in these classes. 

The combinaison of K3 and Xtend allows to address a wide range of activities related to model element manipulation. This includes activites such as:

* weaving operational semantics in metamodel definition
* defining model to model transformations
* defining model to text transformations

[NOTE]
====
For an even larger range of activities, K3 is natively used by Melange. Melange allows to build a type system for models and enable scenarios such as:

* **Language extension** Using high-level operators (e.g. inheritance, merge), language definitions can be manipulated, extended or restrained to create new DSLs.
* **Model polymorphism** Melange’s type system supports
 model polymorphism and substitutability, and the definition of generic 
transformations that can be applied on models originating from different
 DSLs.
====


Technically, K3 consists in a set of active annotations that can be used in 
plain Xtend files to express e.g. aspects, pre/post conditions or 
invariants, and uses Xbase as the expression language for operations 
bodies.

NOTE: Actually, many of K3 annotations are not dependent on EMF/ecore and can also work on plain java classe.

=== Key features

==== Full java compatibility

**Integrating Kermeta and java code has never been that easy !**

K3 action language is built as an extension to Xtend that in turn is able to fully reuse existing java bytecode. **Java code can be used from Xtend/K3 and vice versa**.

:mag: Actually, Xtend generates java code for its classes, so once compiled and deployed you may not even known that it was written in Xtend/K3. If you are curious, you can have a look to the _xtend-gen_ folder to see these generated java classes.


:mag: Technically K3AL is a set of [active annotations](http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation.html#activeAnnotations) for Xtend. These annotations will support the K3 specific concepts (@Aspect, @Singleton, ...) and generate the appropriate java code. 

TIP: Despite that Kermeta was first intended to model manipulation, this java integration means that K3AL can be used for any kind of program.


==== Open class mechanism




As all other versions of Kermeta, K3 Action Language leverages the open-class mechanism. It
allows to "re-open" existing meta-classes of a metamodel to insert new features such as attributes, references, or operations. **Please note that return types of aspects methods cannot be inferred: they must be explicitly written!**

```k3
package mypackage

import fr.inria.diverse.k3.al.annotationprocessor.Aspect

import mypackage.OtherClass
import static extension mypackage.OtherClassAspect.*

@Aspect(className=OtherClass)
class OtherClassAspect {
	var int foo = 1

    def void display (){
         prinln("I am OtherClassAspect")
         // The keyword _self must be used to refer to attributes and operations of the class and aspect.
         _self.foo = 2
         _self.callingOnOperationOfOtherClass()
    }
}
```

This mechanism serves as the basis for the definition of aspects on metamodels elements, enabling aspect-oriented modeling that helps to model complex software artifacts composed of
intertwined and cross-cutting concerns.

Typical use of such construct are the Visitor and Interpreter design patterns which are implemented in a more elegant and readable way with Aspect Oriented languages than with with classical Object Oriented languages.
